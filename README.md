<p> Nature Always Lives On and we are a company who design systems to work in harmony with nature to help it live on in its own evolution.</p>
<p> nalo network </p>
   <p>Our vision ~ To feed the soil, soul, and shine the light on how to regenerate the lands and provide abundance through design principles and practice!  </p>
   <p>Our Mission ~ To create living libraries of plants, animals, insects, reptiles, birds, fish, and humans where nature will always live on.  </p>

      <p> The nalo_collective is a place where nature always lives on
 and environment is entrusted to the beings that inhabit the space!
 We will use the nalo_network to store, track, and redistribute the
abundance that comes from designing nature to always live on. </p>
      <p>On the nalo_network we desire to incentives all aspects of the "earthcare", "people care", and "fairshare" movements that are the foundational ethics of Permaculture.
We do this to insure that nature always lives on! By creating a way to connect the land owners, with designers, and then with the beings that will be doing the physical work of the earth-care process! </p>
      <p>
The care of the earth is an ongoing process that requires our collective resources, energy, ideas, and time process in order to insure that we as humans are always able to live on in harmony as nature.
Through the connection of humans to their inherit gifts that they wish to offer/share, we will build a network of landsites we call "living libraries".
These libraries will be home to an abundance of life and material creations of the humans and other natural beings. </p>
      <p>
We will catalog and track the efforts, energy, time, and gifts shared by all beings to ensure the redistribution of abundance that is created through the harmonious interactions of beings with the natural world.
Journey around the nalo network to find your path for creating the life systems which you desire to interact with. Find your gift that you wish to give to yourself and the community! </p>
      <p>
"Through the sharing of our gifts we will create the abundance that is inherent of a  balanced naturally occurring organism." </p>
